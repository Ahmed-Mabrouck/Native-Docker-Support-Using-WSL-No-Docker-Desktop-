# Native Docker Support Using WSL No Docker Desktop
This is a complete guide to configure your docker on Windows machines using WSL without Docker Desktop for better performance and license issue for enterprise.

## Install Latest Version of Ubuntu WSL2 from Microsoft Store

```powershell
wsl --list --online
wsl --install -d <DistroName>
```

Replace `<DistroName>` with the latest Ubuntu distro.

For more details follow this official tutorial: üîó [Install WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Install Docker on Your WSL2

### Setup Docker's apt repository

```bash
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

### Install Docker's Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Verify Successful Installation by Running hello-world Image

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

For more details follow this official tutorial: üîó [Ubuntu | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

## Configure Docker to Run as Service within WSL Startup

### Configure Docker to Run without sudo

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Verify Successful Configurations to Run without Sudo

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### Make Sure that systemd Service Manager Is Enabled

#### Run The Following Bash Command

```bash
cat /etc/wsl.conf
```

#### Make Sure that the File Contains the Following Lines (Mainly at The Top of The File)

````bash
[boot]
systemd=true
````

:exclamation: If The File Does not Contain The Above Lines (Most Probably Will Contain Them) or the file is not created, Create it and add them to the top of the file.

#### Add Docker as Services to systemd Service Manager

````bash
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
````

For more details follow this official tutorial: üîó [Post-installation steps | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

## Configure Docker Host to Be Exposed for Remote Connections

### Creat a New Docker Context that Exposes Host for Remote Access

````bash
docker context create wsl --docker host=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 --description "WSL exposed host context"
````

### Configure Docker to Use wsl Context

````bash
docker context use wsl
````

### Make Sure The Context Successfully Selected

#### Run the Following Bash Command

````bash
docker context ls
````

#### Make Sure that the Output Is as Follows (an (*) at wsl which means it is currently selected)

````bash
NAME      DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT               ERROR
default   Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock
wsl *     WSL exposed host context                  tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
````

For more details follow this official tutorial: üîó [Docker contexts | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/manage-resources/contexts/)

## Configure Windows Host Machine to Connect Remotely to WSL Docker Host

### Test Connectivity

#### :link: Navigate to the Following URL from Your Windows Host Machine: 

````code
http://localhost:2375/version
````

#### You Should Receive a JSON Response Contains Informaton about You WSL Docker (Info varies, success response is the core)

````json
{"Platform":{"Name":"Docker Engine - Community"},"Components":[{"Name":"Engine","Version":"28.3.3","Details":{"ApiVersion":"1.51","Arch":"amd64","BuildTime":"2025-07-25T11:34:09.000000000+00:00","Experimental":"false","GitCommit":"bea959c","GoVersion":"go1.24.5","KernelVersion":"6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2","MinAPIVersion":"1.24","Os":"linux"}},{"Name":"containerd","Version":"1.7.27","Details":{"GitCommit":"05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da"}},{"Name":"runc","Version":"1.2.5","Details":{"GitCommit":"v1.2.5-0-g59923ef"}},{"Name":"docker-init","Version":"0.19.0","Details":{"GitCommit":"de40ad0"}}],"Version":"28.3.3","ApiVersion":"1.51","MinAPIVersion":"1.24","GitCommit":"bea959c","GoVersion":"go1.24.5","Os":"linux","Arch":"amd64","KernelVersion":"6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2","BuildTime":"2025-07-25T11:34:09.000000000+00:00"}
````

### Download Docker CLI Tools on Your Windows Host Machine (Choose the version that matches your WSL Docker version)

üîó [Index of win/static/stable/x86_64/](https://download.docker.com/win/static/stable/x86_64/)

### Extract the Downloaded Archive to any Desired Path and Add this Path to Your PATH Environment Variable on Your Windows Host Machine

### Add DOCKER_HOST from Your Docker WSL Context to Windows Machine Environment Variables

According to your network confiruations on your Windows host machine, choose one of these values for DOCKER_HOST environment variable:

- [x] tcp://localhost:2375 (Mostly that will work)
- [x] tcp://[::1]:2375

### For Each Value of the Above for DOCKER_HOST, Test the Connectivity by Executing the Following CMD/PowerShell Command a New Terminal Window

````powershell
docker ps
````

‚ùóIf both did not work, make sure that your WSL and Docker service are running and healthy.

### Youe Should Receive the Following Response (Containers list info varies, no errors with heads as follows is O.K)

````powershell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
....
````

## üî• Congratulations, Now You Are Able to Use Docker Nateively in Your Windows Machine without Docker Desktop.

## ‚≠ê Bonus Part: Run Your WSL Machine on Your Windows Startup (Log On) to Match Native Experience

### You Can Run the PowerShell Script in That Repo Called: üìÅ WSL-Delayed-Startup-with-KeepAlive.ps1 that can achieve the following:

1. Runs WSL instance on user logon event with a delay (configurable delay can be updated from the file) to eliminate effect on your Windows machine booting performance.
2. It runs an inifite wait process to pin WSL process running until you shut it down manually.
3. It uses Windows Scheduled Tasks to do this job

‚ùìThe script is well-documented and you can ask for help for any updates.
